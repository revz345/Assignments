Assignment DeepLearing, Computer vision and NLP.
 1.Regression on UCI dataset
    To determine the Relative Humidity(RH) and Absolute humidity(AH) on airquality index dataset.
    Initailly performed KerasTuner for obtaining hyperparameters.
    Modelled the Regression problem using Tensorflow 2.0.
    
 2. Transfer learning
    Classification on Cotton disese dataset.
    Implemented using Tensorflow keras.Used pretrained weights of imagenet and trained the model using Resnet 101.
